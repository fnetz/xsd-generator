# xsd-generator

Code generator for XML bindings using XSD schemas, with an aim to stay close to the specification.

## Current Status

This project is still relatively early in development. Core features (like the generation itself)
are yet to produce results that even compile, and the XSD parser needs more maturity.

A long-term goal is to get the project to handle the [XML Schema for Schema Documents][1] itself,
and make the parser use that.
